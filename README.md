# Excel Dashboards for Data Analysis

This repository contains two Excel dashboards created as part of my data analysis training. These dashboards are designed to visualize and interpret various data sets in an interactive manner, focusing on sales data and pizza data. The dashboards are continually being updated and improved.

## Dashboards Overview

1. **Sales Dashboard**: 
   - This dashboard provides an analysis of sales data, including key metrics such as total sales etc..
   
2. **Pizza Dataset Dashboard**: 
   - This dashboard visualizes data related to pizza sales, including metrics such as the number of pizzas sold, revenue, customer demographics, and popular pizza types. It helps analyze pizza sales performance and identify trends.

## Getting Started

To use the dashboards, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Excel file** from the repository.
2. **Open the file in Microsoft Excel**.
3. **Interact with the dashboard** by selecting different filters, viewing charts, and analyzing the data.

## Future Updates

I plan to:
- Add more advanced dashboards and data sets.
- Implement more complex visualizations and interactivity, such as pivot tables and dynamic charts.
- Continuously improve the analysis and functionality based on new learnings.
